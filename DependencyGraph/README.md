# Comments to Evaluators:

This time's assignment is easier than last time (or just because I used my own approach last time)
The code in Dependency Graph class is also really clean. Only thing I'm not satisfied with is that I need track the dependency Graph's size manually, but not just access the size of the dictionary.

# Consulted Peers:

I didn't speak to anyone yet, I will do it if I have time. All of my problems are solved by myself.
