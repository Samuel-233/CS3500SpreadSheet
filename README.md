# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

TThe Spreadsheet application currently possesses functionalities such as evaluating expressions, establishing dependency
relationships, and generating cells with dependencies through the input of formulas containing variables. In this context,
the controller aspect of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is evident.
With the Spreadsheet, users can input data into cells and perform calculations among them. The software ensures validation of
cell inputs and formula names, detecting issues such as incorrect names, values, or circular errors. In such cases, the graphical
user interface (GUI) provides feedback on the identified problems.
Additionally, the application allows users to save and load files as needed. The view functionality leverages the GUI
to enable users to perform actions such as saving, loading, and conducting calculations within the program.

Using the GUI class can create the APP to let the user interact with.
