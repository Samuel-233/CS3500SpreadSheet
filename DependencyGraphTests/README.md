# Comments to Evaluators:

I didn't added too much extra testers, because the given tester is already pretty good.

# Assignment Specific Topics

# Project content
This is a class to store dependency, so that when code is evaluating formula, it can know what should calculate first. 


# Consulted Peers:

I didn't speak to anyone yet, I will do it if I have time. All of my problems are solved by myself.
